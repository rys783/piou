# Differentiable Polygon IOU

This is a PyTorch implementation of differentiable IOU (Intersection Over Union ) basde on the Sutherlandâ€“Hodgman algorithm for clipping 2-D convex and non-convex polygons. The implementation is based on [Mahmoud's implementation](https://github.com/mhdadk/sutherland-hodgman).

TODO: implement a vectorization version of polygon IOU.
